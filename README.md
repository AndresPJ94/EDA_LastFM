# EDA_LastFM
First version of my EDA project made during my data science bootcamp at The Bridge.

NOTES FOR THE RIGHT USE:
1.- If you replace the file data/lastfm.csv with your own statistics you can make your own analysis. 

2.- For the genre analysis you must execute utils/scrap.py with a BASH command and move the file 200.txt into the data folder. 
This feature is gonna be improved in the next version to make it more user friedly.

3.- This script is going to be avaliable in Streamlit ASAP, to make the process easier and to geta better data visualization.
